            <h2>B. System of Warnings and Sanctions</h2>
            <p>We firmly support the philosophy that making mistakes is part of the learning process. This includes mistakes in our behaviour and interactions with others. Only through reflection on our mistakes can we truly grow and become better people each day. Our system of warnings and sanctions is reflective of this belief and includes 4 levels: </p>
            <h3 class="color-green mb-0">LEVEL 1: Verbal Warning </h3>
            <h3 class="color-green mb-0 mt-0">LEVEL 2: Warning of Demerit </h3>
            <h3 class="color-green mb-0 mt-0">LEVEL 3: Demerit </h3>
            <h3 class="color-green  mt-0">LEVEL 4: Suspensión </h3>
            <p>In order for our philosophy to be successful, it is imperative that we receive <b> full support from families </b> in the decisions and processes that we take as a school regarding the specific details and evidence related to each individual case. Below you will find more detailed information about each level and the processes involved. </p>
            <h3 class="color-green decorat-underline">LEVEL 1: Verbal Warning: </h3>
            <p>The purpose of a verbal warning is to <b> remind students </b> of appropriate expected behaviours, and allow an opportunity for <b> immediate reflection and correction. </b> Repeated verbal warnings (3) about the same issue, will lead to a Warning of Demerit. </p>
            <h3 class="color-green decorat-underline">LEVEL 2: Warning of Demerit </h3>
            <p>The purpose of a Warning of Demerit is to <b> engage the students in a deeper level of self-reflection </b> by <b> appropriately informing the parents </b> of the student that an incident has occurred, and involving the student in reflection through a conversation with their tutor.</p>
            <p>During this period of online learning, consequences at either <b class="color-green"> LEVEL 1 </b> or <b class="color-green"> LEVEL 2 </b> will be given for student behaviour that shows a lack of appreciation and compliance with the Attitudes to Learning that fall into these groups. <b> Please note, this list is not exhaustive.</b></p>
